| _Project_         | Transfer Learning for Waste Classification    |

## Instruction on how to run

1. Open google colab and upload `notebook/Hanumeswara_Kulkarni_Abhijit.ipynb`.
2. Create a folder in the same gmail account's drive with a name `DSML_Project`. Make sure this folder is just under a folder `MyDrive`.
4. Upload `data` folder inside the `DSML_Project` directory.
5. File structure should look like this:

```
MyDrive
    - DSML_Project
        - data
            - RealWaste
                - 1-Cardboard
                - 2-Food Organics
                .
                .
                .
```

6. You can run the code from the ipynb file. (You can use pre-trained weights or train these models from scratch!)

## Note

1. This project is entirely done on Google Colab enabled with GPU.
